**user**: hello
[Context: Notes: Software & Tool/Ollama.md]
[Timestamp: 2025/11/14 19:13:26]

**ai**: Okay, the user said "hello". Let me check the active note they provided. The note is about Ollama, a local LLM runtime. The content includes commands like ollama run, list, rm, create, and some environment variables. There's also a mention of the system prompt and a Docker example.

Since the user just greeted me, I should respond politely. They might be testing if I'm active or want to start a conversation. I'll acknowledge their greeting and offer assistance. No need to mention the Ollama details unless they ask. Keep it friendly and open-ended.
Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊

**user**: 11

**ai**: Okay, the user just typed "11". That's a bit confusing. Let me check the history. Previously, they said "hello" and I responded politely. Now they're entering "11". Maybe it's a typo or they meant something else.

Looking at the active note about Ollama, there are commands like ollama run, list, rm, etc. But "11" doesn't directly relate to those. Could they be referring to a command or a parameter? For example, in the Ollama context, there's a mention of setting context length with "/set parameter num_ctx 128000". Maybe "11" is part of a command or a number in a context?

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can handle numerical inputs or if there's a specific meaning in their notes. Since there's no direct reference to "11" in the provided context, I should ask for clarification. They might have intended to ask about a specific command, a model version, or something else related to Ollama. To be safe, I'll prompt them to provide more details so I can assist effectively.
It seems like there might be a typo or incomplete input. Could you clarify what you meant by "11"? Are you referring to a specific command, model version, or something else related to Ollama? 😊
