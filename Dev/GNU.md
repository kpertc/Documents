### BSD
> FreeBSD uses the BSD license, which is a very permissive license that allows anyone to modify and redistribute the code, even more commercial purposes (did Apple come to mind for anyone?).

> The GNU license also allows users to modify and redistribute code, but the key difference is that they are not allowed to commercialize these tools.
