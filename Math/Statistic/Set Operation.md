### set

Latex: [[Markdown#Equation Latex]]

x = {3, 12, 5, 13}
y = {14, 15, 6, 3}

##### Intersection(and)
A $\cap$ B = {3}

##### Union (or)
A $\cup$ B = {3, 12, 5, 13, 14, 15, 6}

<br>

A = {5, 3, 17, 12, 19}
B = {17, 19, 6}

Set Difference
A \ B → A - B = {5, 3, 12}
B \ A → B - A = {6}
A \ A → A - A = { }


{ } → empty set (null set) → ∅
$\varnothing$

{5, 3, 12} = B′ = relative complement set of B in A
relative complement set means not B, in A

<br>

##### universal set → U 

$\mathbb{U} = \mathbb{Z}$

Symbol|Term|Example
---|---|---
$\mathbb{R}$|set of real numbers
$\mathbb{Q}$|set of rational numbers
$\mathbb{Z}$|set of integer
$\in$|is member of|$-5 \in C$ -5 is member of set of C
$\notin$|is not member of|$7 \notin C$ 7 is not member of set of C

<br>

##### subset

A subset of a set A is any set B such that every element of B is also an element of A
A strict subset is a subset that isn't equal to the original set

A $\subseteq$ A, every set is subset itself
A is not strict subset of A

---

A = {1, 3, 5, 7 ,18}
B = {1, 7, 18}
C = {18, 7, 1, 19}

B is subset of A
A is superset of B

B is strict / proper subset of A

---

Symbol|Term|Example
---|---|---
$\supseteq$|is superset of|A $\supseteq$ B
$\supset$|is strict/proper superset of| A $\supset$ B
$\subseteq$|is subset of|B $\subseteq$ A
$\subset$|is strict/proper subset of|B $\subset$ A

Probability of A given B:  $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$
在B发生的时候，A发生的概率
