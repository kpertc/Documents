[Probability: the basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/basic-theoretical-probability/a/probability-the-basics)

$$ P(A) = \frac{\text(outcome)}{\text(all possibility outcome)} $$

0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
Never happen - Always happen

### Sample Space

- Coin: {T, H}
- 2 Coins: {HH, HT, TH, TT}
- Rolling dice: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

##### Sample Spaces for ==Compound Events==

e.g. 
flavors: chocolate / vanila / 
Size: small / medium / large 

<br>

### Addition
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

<br>

### Multiplication
##### Compound Probability of Independent Events

[The general multiplication rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/multiplication-rule-dependent/a/general-multiplication-rule)

###### Independent Probability
两次正面硬币的概率，无关系事件
{HH, HT, TH, TT}
P(H,H) = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{4}$

三次正面硬币的概率
P(H,H,H) = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{8}$

###### Dependent Probability

### Experimental Probability (实验概率)
Theoretical Probability != Experimental Probability
> Results from an experiment don't always match the theoretical results, but they should be close after a large number of trials.

- use random number to simulate experiment
