his is how we would write the limit of `f` as `x` approaches 3

<br>

-   Unbounded (Limit does not exist)
-   Limit does not exist


Only tells when approach, not

One sided limits

$\mathop{\lim }\limits_{x \to 8^- }$

$\mathop{\lim }\limits_{x \to 8^+ }$

两个方向不连续 dose not exist

$\mathop{\lim }\limits_{x \to 8 }$ = does not exist
