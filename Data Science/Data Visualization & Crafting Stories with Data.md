The graphic representation of data

-   Looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conclusions about data    
-   Creating visuals using raw data to tell a story

Visual → convincing story → change others' mind

<br>

### Examples of data visualizations

1.  ##### Bar Graphs
    
     ![[Data Science/img/Data Visualization & Crafting Stories with Data img/bar-graph.png]]
    
      Use size contrast to compare two or more values
    
      X-axis - horizontal / bottom
    
      Y-axis - vertical / left
    

2.  ##### Line Graphs
    
    ![[line-graph.png]]
    
      Help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data
    

3.  ##### Pie charts
    
    ![[pie-chart.png | 400]]
    
      Show how much each part of something makes up the whole
    

4.  ##### Maps
    
    ![[maps.png]]
    
      Help organize data geographically

==Info can be manipulated & misleading through intentional scaling, visual proportion==

<br>

### Where you'd like your audience to focus on

Too much content → distracting

Too little content → confusing / unclear / less meaningful

  

-   Time series charts
    
-   Histograms
    
-   Ranked bar charts
    
-   Correlation charts
    

<br>  

##### Histogram (直方图，矩形图)

A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges

![[histogram-1.png]]|![[histogram-2.png]]
---|---  

<br>

##### Correlation charts

![[Correlation charts.png]]

Show relationships among data

  

##### Causation

Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome

<br>

### Statics / Dynamic (Interactive) Visualizations

Tableau → Interactive

A business intelligence and data visualization tool allowing users to make sense of their data through interactive charts, graphs and diagrams.

==More freedom to user, less control==

<br>

### Art & Data

##### The elements of art

-   Line - thickness, direction, color, straight, curve
    
    ![[element-line.png]]
    
-   Shape(2D) - contrast, symmetrical, asymmetrical
    
    ![[pie-chart.png | 400]]
    
-   Color - Hue, intensity, value (Shade)
    
-   Space
    
-   Movement
    

<br>

### Data Visualization Impact

##### Which one will make it easier for the user to understand the point you're trying to make?

Bar Graph vs Stacked Bar Graph|Ordered Bar vs Ordered Column vs Grouped Bar

##### Data Composition

Combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as a whole

Composition|Relationships

<br>

##### Effective Visuals

-   Clear meaning
    
-   Sophisticated use of contrast
    
-   Refined execution

<br>

### Data Design Thinking

Design Thinking - A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way

##### Five phases of the design process

-   Empathize
    
-   Define
    
-   Ideate
    
-   Prototype
    
-   Test

# Crafting Stories with Data

[[YouTube] Crafting Stories with Data | Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://youtu.be/r8KZGpVns3o)

##### Benefits of story

-   Easy for the audience to remember
    
-   Human connection

<br>

Media evolves: Paper → video →

<br>

-   Dashboard - A tool that organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization
    
-   Dashboard filter - A tool for showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest
    

<br>

### Developing Data Stories - Bring ideas to life

> "Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice." - Stephen Few

<br>

##### Data Storytelling

Communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that are customized for each particular audience.

<br>

Examples:

User music preference|Yearly Budget, Savings

<br>

##### 3 Data Storytelling Steps

1.  Engage your audience - Capturing and holding someone's interest and attention
    
2.  Create compelling visuals - show not talk
    
3.  Tell the story in an interesting narrative
    

<br>

One way to visualize the story is word cloud, which could be used in social media & blogs ...

### Accommodate different audiences

-   What role does this audience play?
    
-   What is their stake in the project?
    
-   What do they hope to get from the data insights I deliver?
